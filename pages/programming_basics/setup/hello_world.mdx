## Hello World

To confirm you have everything correctly setup for your development machine, you can create a simple hello world program that tests if rustup, rustc, cargo, & your IDE are correctly configured.

import { Steps } from "nextra/components";

<Steps>
    ### Create Project
    Open a terminal in the directory you want to store projects in and run `cargo new hello_world` to create a new, empty rust project.

    ### Open
    Open the created directory in your IDE of choice.

    ### Check
    Check that syntax highlighting is functioning in src/main.rs.
    Also make sure that when you type invalid code and save the file, you get errors in the IDE.
    If you do not, you may need to install a rust plugin for your IDE (see [IDE Setup](/ide_setup)).

    ### Run
    Run `cargo run` in the directory

    ### Results
    If your terminal prints the message below, you're ready to go with rust!

    ```
    Hello, world!
    ```

</Steps>
