## Tool Installation

To get started, you will need to set up the following tools:

- [Radio Configuration Utility](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2023/Radio/FRC_Radio_Configuration_23_0_2.zip)
- [2023 FRC Game Tools](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/drivers/download.frc-game-tools.html#479842)
- [Rust Toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) or [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- IDE of choice

We recommend using either [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [JetBrains CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/),
but any IDE will work.
