## Bang Bang Control

Bang bang control works on the concept of swapping between 2 states; the bang bang controllers provided in wpilib-rust
also provides support for hysteresis, which is a range of values that the controller will not change state in, along with
input and output clamping.

### Basic Usage

```rust copy
use wpilib::math::controllers::bang_bang::BangBangController;

let mut controller = BangBangController::new();

controller.set_limits(-10.0, 100.0, -1.0, 1.0);

controller.set_tolerance(0.5);

controller.set_set_point(50.0);

let output = controller.calculate(45.0, 20.0);
```

In this scenario, the controller would return 1.0, as the error is greater than the tolerance, given that the set point
is 50.0 and the error is 5.0. If the error was -2.0, the controller would return -1.0 and if it was between -0.5 and
0.5, the controller would return 0.0. As it is within the tolerance zone.

### Bang Bang with Feed Forward

Like a PID controller, the best results are obtained in conjunction with a [feed forward controller](../feed_forward/introduction)
that provides the necessary voltage to sustain the system output at the desired state, so that the bang-bang controller
is only responsible for rejecting disturbances. Since the bang-bang controller can only correct in the forward direction,
however, it may be preferable to use a slightly conservative feedforward estimate to ensure that the shooter does not
over-speed.

```rust copy
let output = controller.calculate(position, 20.0) * 12.0 + 0.9 * feedforward.calculate(setpoint);
```
