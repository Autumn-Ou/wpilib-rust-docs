## Introducing Feed Forward to PID

The primary issues in [PID controllers](./pid) is the lack of knowledge about system dynamics and the potential for
integral windup, adding feed forward outputs with PID feed back outputs allows for the incorporation of system dynamics
into the controller along with solving steady state error.

As feed forward is voltage-based, it is best to use a motor's voltage-based control mode when using feed forward with
PID.

### Implementation

The implementation below shows how to use this to account for the changing dynamics of an arm using
[feed forward](../../feed_forward/types#arm) to solve for steady state error and a [PID controller](./pid).

```rust copy {4-5,9}
use wpilib::math::controllers::pid::PIDController;
use wpilib::math::controllers::feed_forward::Arm;

let mut feedforward = Arm::new(ks, kg, kv, ka);
let mut pid = PIDController::new(1.3, 0.01, 0.2);

pid.set_set_point(target);

motor.set_voltage(pid.calculate(position, 20) + feedforward.calculate(position, velocity));
```

    Be sure to use the correct feed forward system for each system to see
    optimal results!
