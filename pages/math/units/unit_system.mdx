## Unit System

WPILib Rust provides a unit system to help prevent conversion errors, enforce correct inputs and keep code as neat and
readable as possible. Some units can auto convert to the correct type such as feet to meters or degrees to radians,
in addition to this, some math operations on units are supported by default `Meter * Second` will automatically return
`MetersPerSecond`.

### Demo

```rust copy
use wpilib::math::units::time::Second;
use wpilib::math::units::distance::{Meter};

let distance = Meter::new(1.32);
let time_elapsed = Second::new(2.3467);

let speed = distance / time_elapsed;
```

In this case, speed is now type `MetersPerSecond` and can be used as the input to for example a feed forward calculation
requiring velocity.
