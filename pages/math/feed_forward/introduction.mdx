## Feed Forward

A feed forward controller injects information about the system’s dynamics or the desired movement. The feed forward
handles parts of the control actions, then feedback compensates for what one does not or cannot know about the system’s
behavior at runtime.

There are two types of feed forwards: model-based feedforward and feedforward for unmodeled dynamics. The first solves a
mathematical model of the system for the inputs required to meet desired velocities and accelerations. The second
compensates for unmodeled forces or behaviors directly so the feedback controller does not have to. Both types can
facilitate simpler feedback controllers which are covered later in these docs.

All feed forward controllers come with the following functions: calculate either velocity, acceleration, or position
based, and min & max limits for velocity & acceleration.

Feed forward control is often used in combination with PID to eliminate steady state error within
[PID controllers](../controllers/pid/pid) resulting in a [PID FF](../controllers/pid/pid_ff) control system.

### Example

```rust copy
use wpilib::math::controllers::feed_forward::Simple;

let mut feedforward = SimpleMotorFeedforward::new(ks, kv, ka);

let output = feedforward.v_a_calculate(velocity, acceleration);

print!("Max achievable velocity: {}", feedforward.max_velocity(max_voltage, acceleration));
print!("output: {}", output);

motor.set_voltage(output);
```
