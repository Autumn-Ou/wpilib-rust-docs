## Types of Feed Forward Controllers

In WPILib rust, we support four kinds of feed forward controllers:

- Simple: a basic model of a motor or flywheel system
- Static: a primitive model of a motor or flywheel system whose voltage is ignored
- Elevator: a model of an elevator or telescoping system
- Arm: a model of an arm or rotating system with weight on an end

### Simple

Simple controllers can be used for tasks such as controlling a flywheel while taking into account fluctuating system
voltage.

```rust copy
use wpilib::math::controllers::feed_forward::Simple;

let mut feedforward = Simple::new(ks, kv, ka);

let output = feedforward.v_calculate(velocity);

// or

let output = feedforward.v_a_calculate(velocity, acceleration);

motor.set_voltage(output);
```

### Static

Static controllers have the acceleration gain defaulted to zero. Units of the gain values will dictate
units of the computed feedforward. which gives them the name "static"; they are less accurate than simple
controllers but easier to set up.

```rust copy
use wpilib::math::controllers::feed_forward::Static;

let mut feedforward = Static::new(kv, ka);

let output = feedforward.v_calculate(velocity);

// or

let output = feedforward.v_a_calculate(velocity, acceleration);
```

### Elevator

Elevator controllers can be used for tasks such as controlling an elevator or telescoping system.

```rust copy
use wpilib::math::controllers::feed_forward::Elevator;

let mut feedforward = Elevator::new(ks, kg, kv, ka);

let output = feedforward.v_calculate(velocity);

// or

let output = feedforward.v_a_calculate(velocity, acceleration);
```

### Arm

Arm controllers can be used for tasks such as controlling an arm or rotating system with weight on an end.

```rust copy
use wpilib::math::controllers::feed_forward::Arm;

let mut feedforward = Arm::new(ks, kg, kv, ka);

let output = feedforward.p_v_calculate(position, velocity);
```
