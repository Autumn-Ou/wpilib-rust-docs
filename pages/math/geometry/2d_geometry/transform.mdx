## 2D Transforms

### Translation 2D

Operations on a Translation2d perform operations to the vector represented by the Translation2d.

- Addition between two Translation2d `a` and `b` can be performed using the `+` operator adding the two vectors.
- Subtraction between two Translation2d can be performed using the `-` operator subtracting the two vectors.
- Multiplication of a Translation2d and a scalar can be performed the `*` operator.This multiplies the vector by the
  scalar.
- Division of a Translation2d and a scalar can be performed using the `/` operator. This divides the vector by the
  scalar.
- Rotation of a Translation2d by a counter-clockwise rotation (theta) about the origin can be performed by using
  `rotate_by(Rotation2d)`. This is equivalent to multiplying the vector by the matrix:
  $
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) \\
\sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)
\end{bmatrix}
$

- Additionally, you can rotate a Translation2d by 180 degrees by using the unary `-` operator.

### Rotation 2D

Transformations for Rotation2d are just arithmetic operations on the angle measure represented by the Rotation2d.

- Addition between two Rotation2d `a` and `b` can be performed using the `+` operator adding the two angles.
- Subtraction between two Rotation2d can be performed using the `-` operator subtracting the two angles.
- Multiplication of a Rotation2d and a scalar can be performed the `*` operator. This multiplies the angle by the
  scalar.
- Division of a Rotation2d and a scalar can be performed using the `/` operator. This divides the angle by the
  scalar.
- Additionally, you can rotate a Rotation2d by 180 degrees by using the unary `-` operator.

### Transform & Twist 2D

Transform2d which represents a transformation to a pose in 2d space. Twist2d represents a movement along an arc, both
contain a $\begin{bmatrix} \ x, & y, & \theta \end{bmatrix} $ matrix.

Transform2d represents a relative transformation. It has a translation and a rotation component. Transforming a Pose2d
by a Transform2d rotates the translation component of the transform by the rotation of the pose, and then adds the
rotated translation component and the rotation component to the pose.

Twist2d represents a change in distance along an arc. Usually, this class is used to represent the movement of a
drivetrain, where the x component is the forward distance driven, the y component is the distance driven to the side,
and the component is the change in heading.

  <p>
    For non-holonomic drivetrains the y component of a Twist2d should always be
    zero.
