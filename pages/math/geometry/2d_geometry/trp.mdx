## Translation 2D

The translation of a point in 2D is given by the following matrix: `[x, y]`, where x and y are within the field coordinate
system and measured in meters.

```rust copy
use wpilib::math::geometry::trasnlation2d::Translation2d;
use wpilib::math::units::distance::Meter;

let x = Meter::new(1.0);
let y = Meter::new(2.0);

let translation = Translation2d::new(x, y);
```

## Rotation 2D

The rotation of a point in 2D is given by the following matrix: `[theta]`, where theta is the angle of rotation in
radians.

```rust copy
use wpilib::math::geometry::rotation2d::Rotation2d;
use wpilib::math::units::angle::Radian;

let rotation = Rotation2d::new(theta);
```

## Pose 2D

The pose of a point in 2D is given by the following matrix: `[x, y, theta]`, where `x` and `y` are within the field
coordinate system, measured in meters, and `theta` is the angle of rotation in radians. It serves as a combination of
the translation and rotation matrices and is commonly used to represent the state of a robot on the field.

```rust copy
use wpilib::math::geometry::pose2d::Pose2d;
use wpilib::math::geometry::trasnlation2d::Translation2d;
use wpilib::math::geometry::rotation2d::Rotation2d;
use wpilib::math::units::distance::Meter;
use wpilib::math::units::angle::Radian;

let x = Meter::new(1.0);
let y = Meter::new(2.0);
let theta = Radian::new(1.34);

let pose = Pose2d::new(Translation2d::new(x, y), Rotation2d::new(theta));

// or simply

let pose = Pose2d::new_xy_rot(1.0, 2.0, Rotation2d::new(1.34));
```
