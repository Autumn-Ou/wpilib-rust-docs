## 2D Global Coordinate System

The global coordinate system is an absolute coordinate system where a point on the field is designated as the origin.
Positive $\theta$ _(theta)_ is in the counter-clockwise direction, and the positive x-axis points away from the blue
alliance station. While y points left from the blue alliance station.

  <p>
    Note unlike classical WPILib the Gyro class is not inverted from the
    coordinate system. This means if porting code from Java, C++, or Python you
    will not need to invert the gyro.
