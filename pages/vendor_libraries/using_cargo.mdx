# Using Cargo

## Building with Cargo

Cargo serves as both a dependency manager and a build system, to build with cargo is as simple as
`cargo build`, to run unit tests `cargo test` and to deploy your code `cargo wpi-deploy --athena`

## Adding Dependencies

Inside your cargo.toml file under dependencies, dependency names and versions can be added; these deps will pull from
crates.io

```toml copy filename="cargo.toml" /md,mdx/
[dependencies]
nalgebra = "0.32.2"
```

### Feature Flags

Dependencies may also contain optional features that can be included like such:

```toml copy filename="cargo.toml" /md,mdx/
[dependencies]
serde = { version = "^1", features = ["derive"] }
```

### Other Sources

Dependencies can also pull from a git repo or a local file path instead.

```toml copy filename="cargo.toml" /md,mdx/
[dependencies]
wpilog = { git = "https://github.com/oh-yes-0-fps/wpilog-rs", version = "^0.1", features = [ "tracing" ] }
wpilib-macros = { path = "../wpilib-macros", version = "0.1.0" }
```
