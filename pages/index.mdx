## What is the WPILib Rust Project?

Well, it's in the name.

WPILib is the library that is used to program FRC robots.
It is written in Java & C++, and makes up the standard code
base for most FRC teams.
The WPILib Rust project is a port of WPILib in Rust.
It is designed to allow for teams to have
the performance of C++ with the ease of use and memory safety of Rust.
